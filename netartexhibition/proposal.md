> Do you think games is considered as art? If you don't think so, this exhibition is here to persuade you. If you already agree, feel free to skip the first art work and step directly into the appreciation of "Super Columbine Massacre RPG!" by Danny Ledonne.

1. Let Prove! : Game is art
As you arrive at this section, haha, it's quite evident that you might not consider games as an art form. Perhaps you think of games merely as a means of daily entertainment. In fact, games have the ability of making players immersed through their music, narrative, images, and videos. Let's take a look at this artist's exploration of the feasibility of games as an art form, their capacity for good and evil, and their legitimacy as a storytelling medium.

2. "Super Columbine Massacre RPG!" -- Danny Ledonne:    
Violence, bullying, shootings – until recent days, these campus issues continue to trouble American youth and families. Perhaps you think these things will never happen around you, but if they do, how would you respond? Would you feel despair? Danny Ledonne's game accomplishes this by using audio and images from crime scenes, immersing you directly into the scenario, making it feel real.

3. "The Intruder" -- Natalie Bookchin:
This work is created at 1999. It narrates the stories of two male and one female It's quite unbelievable, isn't it? As early as 1999, we could already experience stories through games. However, this game and story are a bit different. It's not a romantic tale, and in fact, this game is a bit peculiar—it's not a singular game. Feeling intrigued? Want to try this game? Unfortunately, it's no longer playable, but we do have recorded gameplay of this game.

4. "RMB City" -- Cao Fei:
Have you ever played The Sims? If yes, you can consider RMB City as the Chinese version of The Sims. It narrates the development, construction of the RMB city. Also, it demostrate the daily life of residents and leaders in the city.  By exploring a series of RMB City-themed art works, you will get a glimpse of China's past, present, and future in this virtual city.

First, I plan to create a homepage and embed a YouTube video introducing why games can be considered as art work on the homepage.

Next, I will display the first work, "Super Columbine Massacre RPG!" below the youtube video. This work is by Danny Ledonne. It narrates multiple school violence and shooting incidents to the audience and players of the game. The piece incorporates audio and images from the shooting scenes into the game, sounding an alarm against violence.

The third work I want to showcase is "The Intruder" by Natalie Bookchin. This is an online art game playable on macOS in 1999. Currently it is unplayableThe game tells a story between men and women by stitching together multiple mini-games, using voice as background audio, and displaying text as subtitles to both the audience and players. It seems that this game is no longer playable current and I plan to place a recording of the game below.

The fourth work I want to exhibit is the "RMB City" by Cao Fei. This work consists of a series of sub-works centered around the construction, development, and life of the residents in RMB City. RMB City is a virtual city that only exists on the Internet. As a video game player, I think this net.art work is somewhat like simulated life, which allows the audience and players to experience both the prosperity of the city and the decay and decline hidden in its corners.
