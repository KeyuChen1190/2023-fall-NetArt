        <p id="curatorialText">
            Art is a form of creative expression, where artists tell stories, express emotions, and explore complex themes through mediums like film, music, and literature. Similarly, games, especially video games, even though they are a more recently emerged field within the last 30 years, can also be used to convey emotional experiences and ideas. Therefore, games can also be considered a form of art. Do you think games are considered as art? If you don't think so, this exhibition is here to persuade you. If you already agree, feel free to skip the first artwork and step directly into the appreciation of 'Super Columbine Massacre RPG!' by Danny Ledonne.

            <h2>1. Let Prove! : Game is art</h2>
            <p>
                This video shows us an artist's perspective on whether games are an artistic form. Admittedly, perhaps the meaning of games for most people is merely a way of daily entertainment. However, in fact, games have the ability to immerse players through their music, narrative, images, and videos. Like traditional works of art such as music, movies, and paintings, games can allow you to experience various emotions, from joy to sadness, from fear to love. Games, as a mirror of culture, reflect the problems that exist in contemporary society.

            <h2>2. "Super Columbine Massacre RPG!" -- Danny Ledonne</h2>
            <p>
                Violence, bullying, shootings – until recent days, these campus issues continue to trouble American youth and families. Perhaps you think these things will never happen around you, but if they do, how would you respond? Would you feel despair? Danny Ledonne's game accomplishes this by using audio and images from crime scenes, immersing you directly into the scenario, making it feel real.

            <h2>3. "The Intruder" -- Natalie Bookchin</h2>
            <p>
                The Intruder was created in 1999 by Natalie Bookchin. It narrates the stories of two males and one female. Quite unbelievable, isn't it? As early as 1999, we could already experience stories through games. However, this game and its story are a bit different. It's not a romantic tale, and in fact, this game is somewhat peculiar — it's not a singular game. Feeling intrigued? Want to try this game? Unfortunately, it's no longer playable, but we do have recorded gameplay of it.

            <h2>4. "RMB City" -- Cao Fei</h2>
            <p>
                Have you ever played Sims? This game shares many similarities with the format of RMB City created by Cao Fei and his team. When you visit works such as RMB City, you can't help but think of the virtual embodiment of iconic games. This innovative digital art piece not only simulates urban life; It can also simulate urban life to delve into the complex process of developing and building a city that reflects the vibrant essence of modern China.

            Through these three games, or rather, art pieces, I believe you have already discovered that the games excel in expressing emotions, narrating stories, and revealing social phenomena. These three aspects are indispensable qualities of any artwork. Therefore, games can indeed be considered as art.
