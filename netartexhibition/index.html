            Do you think games are considered as art? If you don't think so, this exhibition is here to persuade you.
            If you already agree, feel free to skip the first art work and step directly into the appreciation of
            "Super Columbine Massacre RPG!" by Danny Ledonne.

            <h2>1. Let Prove! : Game is art</h2>
            <p>
                As you arrive at this section, haha, it's quite evident that you might not consider games as an art form.
                Perhaps you think of games merely as a means of daily entertainment. In fact, games have the ability of making
                players immersed through their music, narrative, images, and videos. Let's take a look at this artist's exploration
                of the feasibility of games as an art form, their capacity for good and evil, and their legitimacy as a storytelling medium.

            <h2>2. "Super Columbine Massacre RPG!" -- Danny Ledonne</h2>
            <p>
                Violence, bullying, shootings – until recent days, these campus issues continue to trouble American youth and families.
                Perhaps you think these things will never happen around you, but if they do, how would you respond? Would you feel despair?
                Danny Ledonne's game accomplishes this by using audio and images from crime scenes, immersing you directly into the scenario,
                making it feel real.

            <h2>3. "The Intruder" -- Natalie Bookchin</h2>
            <p>
                This work is created at 1999. It narrates the stories of two male and one female It's quite unbelievable, isn't it?
                As early as 1999, we could already experience stories through games. However, this game and story are a bit different.
                It's not a romantic tale, and in fact, this game is a bit peculiar—it's not a singular game. Feeling intrigued? Want to
                try this game? Unfortunately, it's no longer playable, but we do have recorded gameplay of this game.
